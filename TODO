* parameter translation needs to be changed to calibtic
* interfaces/halbe contains parameter specific measurement routines
* controller contains old non-working code for some parameters
* config contains "cable db" values
* config contains default values, as does halbe
* why is there still simulator code running?
* interfaces/adc is very similar to code in ADC calibration
