old issues
* parameter translation needs to be changed to calibtic
* interfaces/halbe contains parameter specific measurement routines
* controller contains old non-working code for some parameters
* config contains "cable db" values
* config contains default values, as does halbe
* why is there still simulator code running?
* interfaces/adc is very similar to code in ADC calibration

these are solved by pycairo.experiment, remaining tasks:
* check and drop interfaces/*
* check and drop config/*
* check (and drop) visualization/*
* drop translations/*
* drop simulator.py
* rewrite controller.py

long term issues
* detect working neurons for given parameter sets (store in redman)
* detect working synapses (see also sunscreen repo)
* calibrate synapses (tau_syn, g_syn)
* calibrate whole wafer
